# Number-Of-Vehicles-in-The-Air
Small set of code just experimenting with vehicles. Simply displays the number of vehicles (air) currently in play for each team.

Doesn't really do muchh useful at the moment but will be used in some way when I do my vehicle block guide :)

Someone might find it useful as it is.
